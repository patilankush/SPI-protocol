# SPI-protocol
SPI Controller is design block that acts as an interface between processor and SPI slaves. SPI architecture is based on one master and multiple slaves. SPI controller has 2 interfaces, one is APB interface used for configuring the SPI registers, address and data, other is SPI interface used for connecting with SPI slaves. SPI uses SCLK, MOSI, MISO and CS to connect master to slave. I was responsible for developing SPI Controller RTL code and verification of the same using SV  Responsibilities  • Listing down design features  • Setting up Testbench and testbench component coding.  • Test Plan development  • Testcase coding
